JellyfinTV simulates a linear TV experience using your existing Jellyfin library. Create virtual channels based on genres, studios, or tags, and the app will schedule programming that runs continuously in the background.

## Features

- **Virtual Channels**: Create channels from specific genres, years, studios, or tags.
- **Continuous Scheduling**: Content is scheduled 24/7. Tuning in at any time starts playback exactly where the "live" broadcast would be.
- **Auto-Refill**: Schedules are automatically topped up as you watch.
- **Auto-Ads**: Put ad files in the respective year folder in `./ads`
- **Direct Streaming**: Plays content directly from your Jellyfin server to your browser.
